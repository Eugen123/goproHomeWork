The project also bundles some of the WebDriver binaries that you need to run Selenium tests in the `src/test/resources/webdriver` directories. These binaries are configured in the `drivers` section of the `serenity.conf` config file:
```json
drivers {
  windows {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/windows/chromedriver.exe"
    webdriver.gecko.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/windows/geckodriver.exe"
  }
  mac {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/mac/chromedriver"
    webdriver.gecko.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/mac/geckodriver"
  }
  linux {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/linux/chromedriver"
    webdriver.gecko.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/linux/geckodriver"
  }
}
```
